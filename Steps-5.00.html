Therefore, I recommend during Bootcamp, the instructor should encourage students to sign up for IPBC and the benefits they can get by doing it like they will assign a mentor for you who will guide them on how to get a job and they will help them in making a professional resume as well and they will also introduce you in many companies.<br>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Group Work:</strong>&nbsp;In IPBC students are having trouble with their assignments and troubleshooting the errors and the help sessions are only held once a week which is making people frustrated because they have to wait a week to resolve their problems which are affecting their efficiency too and is taking more time to finish IPBC. Therefore, I recommend making groups for everyone because getting all alone and doing everything alone instead of doing it in a group will also discourage them to do IPBC so they should make equal groups for everyone.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;">3.&nbsp; &nbsp; I<strong>nterview Preparation:</strong>&nbsp;During in interview, the developers are not quite clear about their responsibilities for work which ends up them saying something out of their responsibilities which will tell the interviewers that either they showing fake experience or they don't have enough knowledge about their field. Therefore, after finishing the tier 2 tool and being ready for placement there should be some sessions for preparing for job interviews so, that students will be used to it this process and not feel hesitation while given their interview.<br>4.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Motivational Stories:&nbsp;</strong>Some of the students are having problems in their interviews and making time to get placement, during that time period people are losing their hopes and are giving up. Therefore, I recommend besides watching motivational videos in Bootcamp they should also encourage people who got their job after completing IPBC to go Infront of students and tell them the story about their success to motivate them more.</div><div style="margin: 0px; color: rgb(40, 60, 70); font-family: -apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;; font-size: 18px;"><img src="https://app.colaberry.com/uploads/ProjectStepsImages/1034/29/1.jpg"><br></div>
